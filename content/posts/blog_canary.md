In 1895, John Scott Haldane proposed bringing warm-blooded animals, most
commonly canaries, into mines to detect high levels of carbon monoxide [^1].
This worked because they would become sick (and stop singing) before the miners did.
Because of this, "Canary in a coal mine" is commonly used as an idiom for
something which warns people of danger.

This blog post is (in a very convoluted sense) a canary for my website, as it
exercises the elements which can be embedded in a blog post. If I broke
something in the server side rendering it will be messed up here, like a canary
in a coal mine.

## Mathematics

Amdahl's law [^2] can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    S = \frac{1}{f + \frac{1-f}{P}}
\end{equation}
