Welcome to my corner of the internet.</p><p>I&rsquo;m currently working as CAD Design Verification Engineer at Apple. I previously
studied at the University of Cambridge for my MPhil, and at the University of
Warwick for my BSc, both in Computer Science. I have spent some time as an
academic officer at the <a href=https://uwcs.co.uk/>University of Warwick Computing
Society</a> and as an intern at Apple.</p><p>In my free time I enjoy choral singing, always try to travel by bicycle instead
of walking (irrespective of how short the journey is), and occasionally rock
climb. When I have the time and opportunity, I also work on various
side projects &ndash; some of which I finish!</p></article></main><footer><p>Â© 2025 Edmund Goodman |
