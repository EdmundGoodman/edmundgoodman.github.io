*Lasagne. What is it? Why is it? This talk seeks to obfuscate the answer to these questions.*

## Abstract

We introduce a system for categorising foodstuffs based on the location of their starch content (The Cube Rule of Food Identification [^1]), give a brief introduction to Group Theory, then combine this knowledge to mathematically define Lasagne, and write a representation of it in Haskell.

## Why does this exist?

As part of my role as an academic officer for the [University of Warwick Computing Society](https://uwcs.co.uk/) in the 2023-24 academic year, I helped organise "Lightning Talks", which are "short (~20 minute) talks about anything and everything to do with computer science".

I wrote and delivered this talk as one of the Lightning Talks in the Michaelmas term of 2023. The [slides](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/The-Mathematics-of-Lasagne/files/13572864/The_Mathematics_of_Lasagne.pdf) and source code for this talk are available on GitHub [^2].
