## What does CS260 mean?

At the University of Warwick, CS260 is the module code for the "Algorithms" class
on the Computer Science course. It is described on the module web-page as follows:

> Data structures and algorithms are fundamental to programming and to
> understand computation. The purpose of this module is to provide students with
> a coherent introduction to techniques for using data structures and some basic
> algorithms, and with the tools for applying these techniques to computational
> problems.

## Why did you do a revision lecture about it?

Near the end of the term in which the module runs, there is a class test which
contributes to 20% of students' grade.

As part of my role as an academic officer for the University of Warwick Computing Society [^2] in the 2023-24 academic year, I decided to run a revision lecture on the module content, based on my experience of taking the class test two years prior.

## How did the lecture go?

In total, around 80 people attended the lecture (about 1/3rd of the students taking the module -- slightly visible in the last photo in the gallery), which is pretty successful given that it was a student-lead event with minimal advertising! On top of this, the lecture seemed broadly well-received as helpful by those who attended.

Personally, I found giving the lecture very fulfilling - it is really cool (if a little intimidating) to give a technical lecture to a moderately large group of people. If given the opportunity I would definitely do it again, but I fear my career is likely to be in the direction of industry rather than academia, so I am unlikely to be giving many such lectures on the future.
