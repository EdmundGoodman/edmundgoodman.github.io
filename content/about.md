Hello there :wave: ! Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm currently studying at the University of Cambridge for an MPhil in Advanced
Computer Science. I previously studied at the University of Warwick, and have
spent some time as an academic officer at the
[University of Warwick Computing Society](https://uwcs.co.uk/) and as a CAD
Design Verification intern at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/).

In my free time, I sing in the
[Peterhouse Chapel Choir](https://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/chapel-choir), always try to
travel by bicycle instead of walking (irrespective of how short the journey
is), and occasionally rock climb and reel. When I have the time and opportunity,
I also work on various side projects -- some of which I finish!
