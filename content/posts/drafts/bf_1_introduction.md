## BrainF

This blog post series focusses on the popular esoteric language we refer to as ``BrainF'' to cater to the whims of modern SEO.

BrainF is interesting as it has a very short instruction set whilst still being
Turing complete [^]. This short instruction set makes it difficult to write
complex programs, but easy to write a correct compiler for it, having a trivial
grammar and simple semantics, shown below:
