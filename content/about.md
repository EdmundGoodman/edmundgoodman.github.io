Hello there :wave: ! Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm currently working as CAD Design Verification Engineer at Apple. I previously
studied at the University of Cambridge for my MPhil, and at the University of
Warwick for my BSc, both in Computer Science. I have spent some time as an
academic officer at the [University of Warwick Computing
Society](https://uwcs.co.uk/) and as an intern at Apple.

In my free time I enjoy choral singing, always try to travel by bicycle instead
of walking (irrespective of how short the journey is), and occasionally rock
climb. When I have the time and opportunity, I also work on various
side projects -- some of which I finish!
